# oncology-project
A serverless React website developed on the Firebase platform. 
The design was meticulously crafted from scratch, following design 
mockups to ensure accessibility and user-friendliness. It incorporates 
protected routes and authentication mechanisms. Data migration 
occurred from the internal storage to Firebase cloud storage. 
Performance was optimized using Firebase's Realtime Database for 
dynamic content and real-time updates. The feature of scheduling 
the rework of practical sessions was implemented for the convenience of students.
